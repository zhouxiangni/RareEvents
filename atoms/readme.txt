The test problem is a 7 atoms island on the (111) surface of an FCC metal. All saddle points lead from this close packed heptamer (shown in red) to some adjacent state. All the atoms in this simulation are identical. The interaction between the atoms is a very simple pairwise additive Morse potential.
